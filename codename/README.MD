# Example
Info files name must be "info.xml"
This includes information for device "CODENAME".
"CODENAME" is supposed to be the value of ro.product.name,
which can be "cm_CODENAME" or "CODENAME".

THIS IS AN IDEA WHAT A INFO FILE COULD LOOK LIKE IN XML!
WE CAN HAVE OTHER FORMATS AS WELL IF YOU WANT!
